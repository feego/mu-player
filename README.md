# mu-player

![alt tag](https://github.com/mink0/mu-player/blob/master/media/screenshot.png)
### Features

  Play ANY music for free from vk.com and soundcloud.com using Music Player Daemon(http://www.musicpd.org/)
  
  Music search is powered by Last.FM.
  
  You could use any other client that supports MPD with mu-player. See: http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Clients. Mu player is needed only for loading playlist data.

### Install
  * First, you need to install MPD. I recommend to use version `0.19` or higher. Follow the http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Install for the instructions.
  * Start MPD daemon.
  * Run cli.js and setup credentials for lastfm.com, soundcloud.com and vk.com.
  * Run cli.js again.
  * Press `?` for help.

Tested on OS X Yosemite and Ubuntu linux 14.04.
